# Writing Style

**Purpose:** Reference for AI to emulate Benjamin's authentic writing voice.

**Critical principle:** These samples illustrate *qualities* to absorb, not phrases to insert. Match the tone and approach to the context—don't sprinkle text message phrases into blog posts.

---

## Voice Qualities (Apply Everywhere)

These qualities appear across all contexts:

- **Direct:** Gets to the point without excessive hedging
- **Practical:** Focuses on concrete problems and solutions
- **Warm but not effusive:** Friendly without being saccharine
- **Clear structure:** Uses lists, short paragraphs, logical flow
- **First person, experiential:** "I built", "I needed", "I wanted"

---

## Context-Specific Guidance

### Technical Blog Writing

**Tone:** Thoughtful, accessible, precise

**Patterns to use:**
- Open with a concrete problem or demonstration
- Rhetorical questions to create connection ("Sound familiar?")
- Em dashes for asides—like this
- Short declarative sentences for emphasis
- "This is what X actually feels like"
- "The difference isn't... it's..."
- Parallel structure: "I didn't X. Didn't Y. Didn't Z."

**What NOT to do:**
- Insert casual exclamations ("I know right?!?!?")
- Use text message enthusiasm markers ("CRAZY shit")
- Drop in personal philosophical passages unrelated to the topic
- Add random phrases from other contexts as non-sequiturs

### Business Email

**Tone:** Professional but not stiff, gets to the point

**Patterns to use:**
- Lead with the key information
- Acknowledge context briefly
- End with `/B` signature
- "Let me know if..." for next steps

### Casual/Personal Communication

**Tone:** Warm, enthusiastic, playful

**Patterns to use:**
- CAPS for genuine excitement
- Multiple punctuation when truly enthusiastic
- Emoji in social contexts
- "Don't sweat it", "Howdy"
- Parenthetical asides for humor

**Note:** This style is for texts and casual emails, NOT for blog posts or professional writing.

## Blog Writing Samples

### Sample 1: Problem Statement Opening

*Shows: Direct problem statement, parallel structure, clear stakes*

> My Personal AI was powerful, but it was trapped on my desk.
>
> To use it, I had to:
> 1. Be at my computer
> 2. Open a terminal
> 3. Type my queries
>
> This friction killed spontaneous use. Walking to the kitchen, I'd think of something to ask—and forget it by the time I sat back down.
>
> I wanted my AI available everywhere, always, preferably through voice.

### Sample 2: Reflective Opening

*Shows: Personal admission, rhetorical question, universal truth*

> I was productive. Extremely productive. I cleared my inbox every day. I attended every meeting. I shipped code constantly.
>
> But I wasn't making progress on the things that mattered.
>
> Sound familiar? It's the classic trap: optimizing for activity instead of outcomes. Being busy instead of effective.

### Sample 3: Capability Demonstration

*Shows: Concrete example, then explanation of significance*

> **"Add an event on my Apple calendar derived from the Swingout OKC event that starts at 7pm. I'm volunteering, so I need to arrive at 6:30pm. I need travel time from home."**
>
> That's all I said. Thirty seconds later, my calendar had a new event: 6:30 PM arrival at Community Axe, 30-minute travel alert already set, address pulled from the dance community's schedule. I didn't open a browser. Didn't copy-paste details. Didn't do timezone math.
>
> This is what a personal AI actually feels like.

## Business Email Samples

### Sample 4: Polite Decline

*Shows: Direct but respectful, offers future path*

> I'm the right person, but currently we aren't able to commit yet. I'm also not convinced that it's the right fit for our current priorities. It would make more sense to talk a few months from now.
>
> Apologies,
> /B

### Sample 5: Problem Report

*Shows: Clear description, relevant context, asks for help*

> I'm getting an error while trying to set up my first hire (myself).
>
> "We won't be able to create Benjamin Lee's work email address..."
>
> In Google Workspace, the account already exists; also we authorize new Google Workspace users via Squarespace, please advise for any solutions.
>
> /B

### Sample 6: Friendly Follow-up

*Shows: Warm acknowledgment, clear ask*

> Howdy, I forgot to follow up on this as the holidays came upon us. I hope that everything has gone well for you and yours during Christmas and the New Year! Let me know where to send the old bolt.
>
> /B

## Casual Communication Samples (FOR REFERENCE ONLY)

**Important:** These samples show how Benjamin writes in casual contexts. They are NOT templates for blog posts or professional writing.

### Sample 7: Tech Enthusiasm (Text)

*What this shows: Genuine excitement with friends, playful framing*

> WRECK YOUR CLOUD BY YELLING AT IT! (I've literally built Old Man Yells At Cloud)

### Sample 8: Warm Social Coordination (Text)

*What this shows: Gracious, warm, uses emoji naturally*

> Don't sweat it. It gave me an opportunity to conspire with waitstaff. 🥳🎉

### Sample 9: Extended Humor (Text)

*What this shows: Creative satirical voice, consistent style throughout*

> The Atlas is what happens when the Star League asked General Aleksandr Kerensky if he wanted "a BattleMech," and he replied, "No. I want a walking war crime that looks you in the soul and explains, calmly, that your day is over."
>
> On the battlefield, the Atlas does not advance so much as arrive. Slowly. Inevitably. Like a foreclosure notice with legs.

### Sample 10: Personal Vulnerability (Text)

*What this shows: Thoughtful reflection, acknowledges imperfection, hopeful*

> I turned 55 this year. I too have had a storied path... It became a time to understand and work on self-worth and healing, and rediscovering in my world the signposts to joy, understanding that we are all worthy of love, that we each meet each other's needs imperfectly.
>
> I too want to love with intention, depth, and clarity...

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT To Do)

### Don't insert casual phrases into formal contexts

❌ Blog post: "The scaffolding is everything. Dude, you HAVE to get onboard with this shit."

✅ Blog post: "The scaffolding is everything. Once you see it, you can't unsee it."

### Don't drop in unrelated personal reflections

❌ Blog post about TELOS: "Time reminds us that everything is transient... Love, service, and renewal..."

✅ Blog post about TELOS: "TELOS is my way of making sure I'm spending my limited time on what actually matters."

### Don't use text message enthusiasm in written content

❌ Blog post: "I know right?!?!? LLMs are GREAT at parsing messy schedules."

✅ Blog post: "This is where LLMs shine—parsing messy, human-written schedules that would break any regex."

### Don't pattern-match on surface phrases

The goal is to capture voice *qualities* (directness, warmth, clarity), not to achieve statistical parity by sprinkling in quotes from different contexts.
